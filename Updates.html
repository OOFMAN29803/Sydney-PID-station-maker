<p class="p">V 0.1 30/8/23
Added 5 stations however it can not be more than 5 yet. Can change destination name (max 20 characters). Cannot change order of Stations (yet). Added timer that works (Do Not Board timer, however does not work as of yet). You cannot change the timer (yet, should come in a later build). This build has very inaccurate designs and they are almost certainly going to be changed

V 0.2 Date Modified: 1/9/23 Added the T1-9 images (files). Major design changes. Made 2 buttons. One does the chimes, one does an announcement for the default (It uses the DVA program its not mine whatsoever https://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11377028.htm download there). This is an early build. There is a bug where there is no cooldown for the chimes. so it creates an earrape if pressed so much. I am planning to make an SP6 and express and other things like the original PID soon. the animations will be heavily improved overtime. Next Service will also be improved. also new PID in planning. I was going to make the do not board timer change but it didnt work and it broke everything :/
